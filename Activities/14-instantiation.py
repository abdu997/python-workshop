    In this activity we will convert the Patient class we constructed in the past activity to a dynamic class.
    1. Copy the code from the past classes activity and paste it here.
    2. Create the constructor (__init__) function.
    3. Set patient name, VCO2, VA, HCO3, FIO2, Pb, SaO2 and Hb as class properties.
    4. Create an instance of the class and test the class functions using these values.
        Patient 'Lewis Hamilton' whose VCO2 = 2, VA = 4, HCO3 = 1, FIO2 = 9, Pb = 20, SaO2 = 3 and Hb = 6 
    5. Print the results.
