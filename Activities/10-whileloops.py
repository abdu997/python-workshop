    In this exercise, you will have to create a program that will prompt for and store patients' information.
    1. Create a variable to be used for the while loop conditions.
    2. Create an empty list to store the patients.
    3. Create the while loop using the variable created in step 1.
    4. Prompt for the patients name, age and family practitioner.
    5. Store the answers in a dictionary.
    6. Append the dictionary to the patients' list.
    7. Prompt if the user would like to add another patient.
    8. Once the loop is over, print the patients' list.
    9. Store the patients list into a file :D
        Now I know we haven't covered this, I added this step to get you to practice your Google-Fu. 
        There isn't a course in the world that will cover all topics, so you will have to learn how to learn new topics. 
        Woah, that was meta.
        HINT: Keep in mind that the patients list is a list and must be converted to a string before storing it in a file.
